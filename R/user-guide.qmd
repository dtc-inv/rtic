## Summary

Welcome to Return Analytics, an app to support time-series analysis of investment data. The User Guide begins with Quick Start followed by an outline of the different pages on the app. The next sections are more in-depth manuals on how to use each feature of setting up the analysis, viewing it on the app, exporting to PowerPoint and Excel, creating custom Portfolios, and uploading custom time-series.

### A Note on Scope

Before we launch into the quick start I'll point out the data scope of this app. There are investments that are stored "permanently" meaning they are in a database. When the app starts they are automatically loaded into the "local" version of your session of the app. These time-series include DTC Platform investments, indexes, economic time-series (mainly CPI), and the top 100 mutual funds and ETFs by AUM. If there are mutual funds or ETFs that you commonly come across and want added please let me know.

Users have the option to create custom portfolios and add time-series via Excel uploads. These are also stored "permanently" in a database. However they are not automatically loaded when the app starts. There are buttons to add them temporarily for your current session of using the app. The Port Mgmt and Time-Series Mgmt sections will discuss in more detail how to upload, store, and load these types of data.

## Quick Start

![](images/clipboard-2332465050.png)

Use the Select Investment(s) drop down menu to start adding investments to the analysis. You can select multiple investments at one time and the menu is searchable.

Click the Add Selection button to bring the selected investments into a table below.

![Click the Run Analysis button and you're good to go!](images/clipboard-2192108842.png)

## General Navigation

![](images/clipboard-3822882887.png)

The top of the page has five sections: Analysis, Export, Port Mgmt, Time-Series Mgmt, and Help!

-   Analysis is where you set up, run, and view the time-series analytics.

-   Export gives two options to export the analysis in PowerPoint and Excel after you run the analysis.

-   Port Mgmt allows users to add, save, and edit custom portfolios.

-   Time-Series Mgmt allows users to upload and save time-series from Excel.

## Setup

The Setup page is the landing spot for the app. This is where you start the analysis by selecting investments, a benchmark, and the date range.

### Date Range

![](images/clipboard-4107250010.png)

This is a standard calendar widget where you can control the date range of the analysis. All the time-series in the analysis are monthly, if you select a mid-month date as the start date, e.g., March 16, the analysis will use the monthly return of the whole month of March as the start date. Conversely for the end date the analysis will end in the prior month, e.g., March 16 will result in February being the last monthly return. The analysis requires at least 6 months of data, if you select a date range of less than 6 months you will get an error message when run the analytics.

### Select Benchmark

This drop down menu will allow you to select one benchmark. More indexes can be added to the analysis via the Select Investments dropdown. Calculations such as beta or tracking error are limited to one relative benchmark. All the other "standalone" calculations such as return and volatility can be done with as many indexes as you want to add via Select Investments.

### Select Investments and Buttons

![](images/clipboard-598421680.png)

The Select Investments is a drop down menu with all the available options for the analysis. You can select multiple investments at one time and the menu is searchable. Seaching for "value" will result in a subset that has "value" anywhere in the name of the fund. The naming convention of ETFs and mutual funds has a parenthetical ticker which allows you to search by ticker as well.

![The Filter drop down menu allows you to apply filters to subset the Select Investment menu. This can be helpful if you want to see all of the index options available. Use the Reset Filters button to clear filters when you want to return to the full menu or before applying a new set of filters.](images/clipboard-1700232907.png)

After selecting the desired investments use the Add Selection button to start adding the investments to a table that will pop up below.

![](images/clipboard-3691335206.png)

Please note this will not run the analysis. The table below is a staging point to check what investments you've added. You can continue to add more investments with the Select Investments menu and Add Selection button. The Clear Table button will clear the table below if you want to start over.

The Get Dates button will populate the beginning and ending dates for each investment. This is helpful in determining how far back the analysis can go. You will be limited to the most recent start date.

After you've set up all the desired investments in the table, selected your benchmark, and the date range, you are ready to click the Run Analysis button. When successfully completed you'll get a pop up message stating the analysis is complete.

## Tables and Charts in the App

![](images/clipboard-1660790738.png){width="448"}

The left hand side of the Analysis tab mainly follows the worksheets of the previous version of this tool.

-   Performance Statistics has a table with MPT stats such as Return, Volatility, Sharpe, etc.

-   Trailing Performance shows returns over given calendar periods.

-   The Wealth Chart shows cumulative wealth of \$100 initial investment.

-   Risk & Return Chart plots the Return and Volatility trade-off.

-   Drawdowns graphs the worst drawdown for each investment, how each investment performed during the six worst benchmark periods, and a line-plot of all the drawdowns over time.

-   Rolling Stats contains rolling returns, volatility, Sharpe ratios, tracking error, beta, and correlation.

## Export

Exporting to Excel will download a workbook with the monthly returns of each time-series, all the tables in the analysis, and the time-series of the graphs. Please note the graphs themselves won't be re-created but all the data that generates the graphs get's outputted into Excel.

Exporting to PowerPoint puts all the tables and graphs into a pptx.

## Port Mgmt

### Manage

![](images/clipboard-1557825638.png)

The landing page for Port Mgmt is where you can manage your existing portfolios. Each user will have a folder from the top drop down menu where they can store their custom portfolios.

![](images/clipboard-498944502.png){width="417"}

If you have already created a portfolio the Add to Investment Options button will add it to the analysis. This is done in this session and will not permanently store the portfolio in the app. If you restart the app or use it another day and want to view a custom portfolio you'll have to navigate here first and add it to the analysis again.

The Delete button will remove a saved custom portfolio from your folder, this is a permanent action and cannot be undone.

The portfolios and all data are stored in [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/?trk=fecf68c9-3874-4ae2-a7ed-72b6d19c8034&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvBhumThZdY_U9ElzxCt3_tQuaE8iPpaujPGnK9nmaS0dN--SGEltlxoCQfUQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536452728638!e!!g!!aws%20s3!11204620052!112938567994&gclid=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvBhumThZdY_U9ElzxCt3_tQuaE8iPpaujPGnK9nmaS0dN--SGEltlxoCQfUQAvD_BwE "https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3/?trk=fecf68c9-3874-4ae2-a7ed-72b6d19c8034&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvBhumThZdY_U9ElzxCt3_tQuaE8iPpaujPGnK9nmaS0dN--SGEltlxoCQfUQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!536452728638!e!!g!!aws%20s3!11204620052!112938567994&gclid=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvBhumThZdY_U9ElzxCt3_tQuaE8iPpaujPGnK9nmaS0dN--SGEltlxoCQfUQAvD_BwE") and the App's local data are in [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?trk=36c6da98-7b20-48fa-8225-4784bced9843&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvNcnDTIj_AhzEHXC9SY2yx9eXaZrzwHc96buPxDiHQSjFzfrpC0PzhoCkiUQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!467723097970!e!!g!!aws%20ec2!11198711716!118263955828&gclid=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvNcnDTIj_AhzEHXC9SY2yx9eXaZrzwHc96buPxDiHQSjFzfrpC0PzhoCkiUQAvD_BwE "https://aws.amazon.com/pm/ec2/?trk=36c6da98-7b20-48fa-8225-4784bced9843&sc_channel=ps&ef_id=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvNcnDTIj_AhzEHXC9SY2yx9eXaZrzwHc96buPxDiHQSjFzfrpC0PzhoCkiUQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!467723097970!e!!g!!aws%20ec2!11198711716!118263955828&gclid=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvNcnDTIj_AhzEHXC9SY2yx9eXaZrzwHc96buPxDiHQSjFzfrpC0PzhoCkiUQAvD_BwE").

### Create / Edit

#### Create New

![](images/clipboard-2611438698.png)

To create a new portfolio navigate to the Excel widget and start by selecting Assets. The cells contain all the investment available for analysis. The cell is searchable, e.g., you can type search for part of a name or ticker. If you enter a description not found in the investment options the cell will turn red a warning.

![](images/clipboard-1348308679.png)

You can enter weights several ways. 0.60 will be interpreted as 60%. Do not enter the % sign, only numeric data are accepted. The cell will highlight red as a warning if any non numeric data are entered.

![](images/clipboard-352348648.png)

If you keep the default Force Weights to Equal 100%, 60 can also be interpreted as 60% if the values sum to 100. This feature will sum the values you enter and calculate the weights by dividing each line item by the total.

Correct way of assigning 60% / 40%.

![](images/clipboard-2934789163.png)

Also a correct way of assigning 60% / 40%.

![](images/clipboard-2042067388.png)

Incorrect: non numeric data entered

![](images/clipboard-2064299190.png)

Incorrect: the total will equal 60.4 and VOO will get 60 / 60.4 or 99.3% weight.

![](images/clipboard-2972957740.png)

Incorrect: the portfolio will be 6000% / 4000% because Force Weights to Equal 100% is set to FALSE.

![](images/clipboard-2213570219.png)

The default number of rows is 10, if you want to add more assets you can right click in a cell to add more rows.

![](images/clipboard-4076791300.png)

To save the portfolio first make sure you have the desired Save Folder selected.

![](images/clipboard-1461110507.png)

Then give your portfolio a name. If you enter the name of an existing portfolio it will save over it. You can check the names of your exiting portfolio above in the Manage Section.

Finally you can save the portfolio with the Save Portfolio button. When you go back to the Manage Section and re-fresh your folder you will see the new portfolio.

#### Edit Existing

Select the desired folder in the Open PM Folder menu and use the Open Portfolio menu to select the existing portfolio. This will populate the Excel widget below the assets and weights.

After making adjustments use the Portfolio Name and Save Portfolio buttons. If you enter the same name the Save Portfolio button will save over the existing. If you enter a different name it will save as a new portfolio under the different name.

## Time-Series Mgmt

This section allows you to upload a time-series from an Excel file. xls and xlsx are currently supported. If you have a csv file you can save as xslx.

When you land on the page, if you have previously uploaded returns the existing data will be summarized in a table. If you haven't uploaded data then the table will be blank.

![](images/clipboard-2478451445.png)

Similar to the scope of custom portfolios, your previous time-series uploads will be stored in the cloud via AWS S3. If you want to add them to the analysis options you can click the green Add to Analysis button. This will be done locally in the app session while you are using it. If you refresh the app or come back and use the app later it will load fresh without any of your returns. You can repeat this process to add them back for the session. Sessions will automatically time-out after 15 minutes of idle time.

To upload a file us the Upload File button, this will bring up a window to navigate and select the Excel file you want.

![](images/clipboard-3131252821.png)

If read in successfully you'll get a pop up message saying so and a summary of the new time-series will populate in the table below. This is meant as a staging ground to check your upload. You can see the start and end dates of the time-series as well as the annualized return and volatility. There's also a mapped feature to show if you've already uploaded a time-series in the past. For existing time-series, the new data will fill any missing dates to either back-fill historical data or continue to add more recent data.

If everything looks good click the Process Upload button and the new data will be saved in your folder. If you want to add to the analysis click the green Add to Analysis button.
